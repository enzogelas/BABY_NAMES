We see a top of names given to babies for each year.

Pros:
- Can easily see which names are popular at a given point, and see the evolution of the popularity of a name
- can see which names stay popular from one year to another, and their potential decline in popularity

Cons:
- not easy to compare years together
- no info on unpopular names

Potential ameliorations:
- offer a small-multiple option for the user to compare specific years after they have seen the global animation
- pick a color scheme to easily diferentiate boys and girls, or do two vizualisations depending on gender assigned at birth
- could add the same vizualisations for least popular names
