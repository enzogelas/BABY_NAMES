We see the most popular name for each département. 

Pros:
- very easy to see if one name is popular for the entire country
- if the visualisation scrolls through the years automatically, we can see the spreading of a name (where it started getting popular, and how it spreads)
- possibility to see the evolution of the popularity of a chosen name accross the different départements

Cons: 
- not easy to see if some names are more popular/time consistent in a given region, because we only take the most popular name

Potential ameliorations:
- differentiate girls/boys
- add an option to focus on a specific area
- add an option to see more names
