We see the most popular name for each d√©partement. 

Pros:
- very easy to see if one name is popular for the entire country
- if the visualisatio scrolls the years automatically, we can see the spreading of a name (where it started getting popular, and how it spreads)

Cons: 
- not easy to see if some names are more popular/time consistent in a given region, because we only take the most popular name

Potential ameliorations:
- differentiate gril/boys
- add an option to focus on a specific area
- add an option to see more names
- potentially, follow the popularity of a specific name through time (could color according to the ratio babies having this name on babies born this year)
